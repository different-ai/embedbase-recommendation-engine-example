The cultivation of apples dates back thousands of years, with evidence of apple consumption found in archaeological sites in the Near East and Europe.

Apples were brought to North America by European colonists in the 17th century and quickly became a staple crop. Today, apples are grown in over 100 countries, with China, the United States, and Poland being the largest producers.
